SocketCluster integration tests
===============================

To launch automated integration tests, you need to install dependencies into a test/node_modules/ subdirectory
by running 'npm install' while inside the test/ directory.
Launch a test by running the appropriate index.js file using the 'node' command.
Each subdirectory (aside from the node_modules directory) tests different aspects of SocketCluster.
